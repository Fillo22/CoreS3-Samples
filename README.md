# CoreS3 Samples

This repository contains a collection of sample projects and code snippets demonstrating the use of the M5Stack Core S3 in various applications. Each sample is designed to showcase different features and capabilities of the Core S3 platform, making it easier for developers to get started with their own projects.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in the repository represents a separate project or example. Here is a brief overview of what each directory contains:

- `LTE`: Connect to internet using COM.LTE module
- `Humidity_CO2`: Read environment data like CO2 and Temperature with SCD41 sensor
- etc.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you will need the following:

- M5Stack Core S3 device
- Arduino IDE or compatible software
- Necessary libraries and drivers installed (see individual project folders for specific dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Fillo22/CoreS3-Samples.git
   ```
2. Open the Arduino IDE, and navigate to the folder of the project you are interested in.
3. Open the `.ino` file for the project.
4. Compile and upload the code to your M5Stack Core S3.

## Usage

Each project folder contains a README.md file with specific instructions on how to run and use the example. It is recommended to read these files before attempting to run the samples.
